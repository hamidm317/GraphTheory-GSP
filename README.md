# GraphTheory-GSP
Here is some function and source codes of graph visualization, signal processing and theoretical implementations.

## SimpleGSP_Toolbox

Is a step-by-step implementation of article [A Multiscale Pyramid Transform for Graph Signals
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4942), as an assignment of Graph Signal Processing course.

## GraphDenoising

This matlab source code, is an example of denoising a graph signal, using [gspbox](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/download.html) toolbox of matlab.
